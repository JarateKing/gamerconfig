# gamerconfig
config for best gamer experience tf2

Why I made this? I was sick of mastercomfig being only reliable config. So I made this. It is based on mastercoms' research, my own research and community. I will try to update it daily based on my test. I decided to upload this for greater good.

# includes:
## autoexec.cfg

autoexec file
